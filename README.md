## Welcome! 

I'm Tomasz

I am an ambitious person, constantly learning and developing. I have an open mind, I like to learn. Working in various industries, many years of contact with people, teamwork and a large baggage of experience have shaped my character, including freedom of communication and ease of establishing relationships. Curiosity led me to the world of programming, where I constantly find new challenges. On a daily basis, I am a smiling person and I have a positive approach to the surrounding reality. I treat problems as challenges and failures as feedback.
